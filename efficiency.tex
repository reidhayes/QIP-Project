In this section, we will consider the efficiency of concentrating entanglement: explaining the analysis of Bennett et al.~\cite{bennett1996concentrating}.
Will will show that the entanglement entropy of the resulting maximally entangled state approaches that of the initial state for large $n$.

The expected entanglement entropy after the Schmidt projection is
\begin{align*}
\sef &= \sum_{k=0}^n p_k S_E[\ket{k}] \\
&=\sum_{k=0}^n \underbrace{\binom{n}{k} \cos^{2(n-k)}\theta \sin^{2k}\theta}_{p_k}
 \underbrace{\log_2 \binom{n}{k}}_{S_E[\ket{k}]}
\end{align*}
Since, as we have already shown, $\ket{k}$ is maximally entangled as a $\binom{n}{k}$ state bipartite system.
Recall the entanglement entropy of the initial state was
\begin{align*}
S_{E}^i &= -n \left( \cos^2\theta \log_2 \left(\cos^2\theta \right)
+ \sin^2\theta \log_2 \left(\sin^2\theta \right)\right)
\end{align*}
To demonstrate the efficiency of our method, we wish to show that \\$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}  \sef / S_E^i  = 1$.
This could be achieve with pure mathematical analysis, but there more straightforward and physical approach.

Before taking her $k$ measurement Alice sees her half of system as a mixed state (tracing over Bob's half)
\begin{align*}
\rho_A = \sum_{k=0}^n \cos^{2(n-k)}\theta \sin^{2k}\theta
\sum_{x \in H(k)} \bigotimes_{i=1}^n 
\dyad{\alpha_{x_i}(i)}{\alpha_{x_i}(i)}
\end{align*}

Therefore the probability distribution for $x$ is classical as long as we stick to Alice's local perspective, and may be analysed with the tools of classical probability theory.
Claude Shannon's theory of information tells us that Alice can reduce the entropy of $x$'s probability distribution  by on average no more than $S_H = - \sum_k p_k \log_2 p_k$ by determining the value of $k$ that corresponds to $x$~\cite{shannon2001communication}. A simple example of this that is determining the value of one out of ten coin-flips reduces the entropy from by $1$ bit, from $10$ bits to $9$ bits. The reader is referred to Shannon's seminal work for greater detail~\cite{shannon2001communication}.

Notice that since $\rho_A$ is diagonal the entropy of entanglement is exactly the entropy of the probability distribution for $x$.
Therefore the statement result from information theory is
$$
\sef \ge S_E^i - S_H \Rightarrow \sef / S_E^i \ge 1 - S_H /S_E^i 
$$
Recall from~\eqref{eqn:pk} that the the probability distribution for $p_k$ is binomial: $B(n, p=sin^2\theta)$.
It is well known that the entropy of the binomial distribution is
$$S_H = 1/2 \log_2 \left(2 \pi e n p (1-p)\right) + \mathcal{O}(1/n)$$

And therefore 
$$
\sef / S_E^i = 1 - \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log(n)}{n}\right)
$$

This results means that this procedure approaches a perfect yield of maximally entangled states as the system size increases.
