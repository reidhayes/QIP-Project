Consider the general Schmidt decomposition for bipartite system:
$$
\cos\theta \ket{\alpha_0} \ket{\beta_0} + 
\sin\theta \ket{\alpha_1} \ket{\beta_1}
$$
Following convention, the Schmidt coefficients are non-decreasing: so $\theta \in [0, \pi/4)$. Clearly, $\theta = 0$ corresponds to zero entanglement, while $\theta = \pi/4$ corresponds to maximal entanglement.

\todo[inline]{add a plot of the entanglement entropy vs $\theta$}

We demand that the entanglement occur only pairwise, and that each pair be entangled to the same degree. Since entanglement entropy is a non-decreasing function of $\theta$, each pair must therefore have the same Schmidt coefficients, although they may have different Schmidt vectors. 

Therefore, the Schmidt decomposition of the $i^{\text{th}}$ pair is  
$$
\cos\theta \ket{\alpha_0(i)} \ket{\beta_0(i)} + 
\sin\theta \ket{\alpha_1(i)} \ket{\beta_1(i)}
$$

And the total state of the system is
\begin{align}
	\ket{\psi} &= \bigotimes_{i=1}^n \left( 
	\cos\theta \ket{\alpha_0(i)} \ket{\beta_0(i)} + 
	\sin\theta \ket{\alpha_1(i)} \ket{\beta_1(i)} \right) \\
	&= \sum_{k=0}^n \cos^{n-k}\theta \sin^k\theta
	\sum_{x \in H(k)} \bigotimes_{j=1}^n 
	\ket{\alpha_{x_j}(i)} \ket{\beta_{x_j}(i)} \\
	&=  \sum_{k=0}^n \cos^{n-k}\theta \sin^k\theta
	\sum_{x \in H(k)} \ket{\phi_x}
\end{align}

Where 
$$
H(k) = \left\{ 
	x \in \ZZ_2^n : \text{the Hamming Weight of x is k} \right\}
$$

and
$$
\ket{\phi_x} = \bigotimes_{j=1}^n 
\ket{\alpha_{x_j}(i)} \ket{\beta_{x_j}(i)}
$$

Notice that the entanglement entropy of $\ket{\psi}$ is
\todo[inline]{calculate the entropy of $\ket{\psi}$}

Since $ \braket{\alpha_j(i)}{\alpha_k(i)} = \braket{\beta_j(i)}{\beta_k(i)} = \delta_{jk} $, we have that $\braket{\phi_x}{\phi_y} = \delta_{xy}$.
Therefore $V_k = \vspan(\ket{\phi_x} : x \in H(k))$ is a subspace of the full Hilbert space with dimension $\binom{n}{k}$.
Furthermore the $V_k$ are orthogonal to each other.

Let Alice perform a von Neumann measurement that projects the state into one of these $V_k$ subspaces. That is, let Alice to measure the observable $A_H$
$$
A_H = \sum_{k=0}^n k \left( \sum_{x \in H(k)}  \dyad{\phi_x}{\phi_x} \right) 
$$

Alice can communicate her result to Bob over a classical channel, or she can just let Bob perform his own $A_H$ measurement: by virtue of the entanglement their results will always agree.

The resulting state is
$$
\ket{k} = \binom{n}{k}^{-1/2} \sum_{x \in H(k)} \ket{\phi_x}
$$

That occurs with probability
$$
p_k = \binom{n}{k} \cos^{2(n-k)}\theta \sin^{2k}\theta
$$
