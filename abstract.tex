Two observers sharing $n$ partially entangled pairs of qubits, with identical entanglement entropy may, through local operations only, generate a smaller number of maximally entangled qubits.
The method for doing so by Bennett et al.~\cite{bennett1996concentrating} approaches perfect yield in the limit of large $n$.
